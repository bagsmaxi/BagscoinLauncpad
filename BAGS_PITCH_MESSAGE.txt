SHORT PITCH - For Twitter DM / Discord
================================================================================

Hey Bags team!

I built Bagscreener - a token explorer specifically for Bags.fm tokens. It shows:
- All Bags tokens with price, mcap, volume
- Creator info (Twitter handles, wallets)
- Fee recipients with earnings breakdown
- Integrated trading via Phantom

I'm already using your public API for creator/fees/claim-stats endpoints.

To make it even better, I'd love access to:
1. Token list endpoint (get all Bags tokens)
2. Token metadata (name, image, bonding status)

I'm launching a token on Bags to fund development. Would love to chat about a potential partnership!

Demo: http://localhost:3001 (will be deployed soon)

Subject: Partnership Proposal - Bagscreener Token Explorer for Bags.fm

Hi Bags team,

I'm reaching out to propose a partnership for Bagscreener, a community-built token explorer I've developed specifically for the Bags.fm ecosystem.

WHAT IS BAGSCREENER?
A dedicated explorer for Bags tokens featuring:
- Token discovery (price, market cap, volume, liquidity)
- Creator information with Twitter/Telegram handles
- Fee recipient breakdown with earnings data
- Integrated trading via Phantom wallet
- Real-time price updates

CURRENT API USAGE:
I'm successfully using your public API:
- /token-launch/creator/v3 - Creator info
- /token-launch/lifetime-fees - Earnings data
- /token-launch/claim-stats - Fee recipients

API ACCESS REQUEST:
To provide complete token discovery, I need:
1. Token list endpoint - Get all/recent Bags tokens
2. Token metadata - Name, image, bonding status by mint
3. (Optional) WebSocket for new token alerts

MUTUAL BENEFITS:
- Increases Bags.fm visibility
- Drives trader traffic to your platform
- Free community-driven development
- Transparent ecosystem tool

FUNDING:
I'm launching a token on Bags.fm to fund:
- Server infrastructure

I'd love to discuss partnership options - from simple API access to deeper integration.

Available for a call anytime. Looking forward to your thoughts!
